The code in this repository is supplementary to our publication **Heartbeat classification using various machine learning models: A comparative study** 




# Design and Implementation details

The task is to predict the ECG heartbeat signal category, which comes from a platform where the ECG data records are recorded, only 1 column of heartbeat signal sequence, where each sample of the signal sequence is sampled at the same frequency and with equal length. The personal information of the patients is protected. To ensure fairness, 80,000 samples are selected as the training set which will be provided for model construction and validation. Another 20,000 samples are provided as the test set. The dataset consists of ECG recordings from 205 heartbeat signals. 

## Getting Started

**To run the script please use this file on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook:**


```notebooks``` folder contains all scripts used to train and test models. More details on how to train and test the code is mentioned inside ```notebooks``` folder.
